{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"**dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**. At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) [CSS 2.1](https://github.com/HNygard/dompdf/tree/master/dompdf/lib) compliant HTML layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer: it will download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational HTML attributes.\r\n\r\nPDF rendering is currently provided either by [PDFLib](http://www.pdflib.com/) or by a bundled version the R&OS CPDF class written by Wayne Munro. (Some important changes have been made to the R&OS class, however). In order to use PDFLib with dompdf, the [PDFLib PECL extension](http://pecl.php.net/package/pdflib) is required. Using PDFLib improves performance and reduces the memory requirements of dompdf somewhat, while the R&OS CPDF class, though slightly slower, eliminates any dependencies on external PDF libraries.\r\n\r\n[![Follow us on Twitter](http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-a.png)](http://www.twitter.com/dompdf)\r\n[![Follow us on Google+](https://ssl.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-32.png)](https://plus.google.com/108710008521858993320?prsrc=3)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n * handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media & @page rules\r\n * supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes\r\n * supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via fopen-wrappers)\r\n * supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed border models, individual cell styling\r\n * image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)\r\n * no dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class\r\n * inline PHP support\r\n \r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n * PHP 5.0+ (5.3 recommended)\r\n * MBString extension\r\n * DOM extension (bundled with PHP 5)\r\n * Some fonts. PDFs internally support Helvetica, Times-Roman, Courier & Zapf-Dingbats, but if you wish to use other fonts you will need to install some fonts. dompdf supports the same fonts as the underlying R&OS PDF class: Type 1 (.pfb with the corresponding .afm) and TrueType (.ttf). At the minimum, you should probably have the Microsoft core fonts. See the font installation instructions.\r\n\r\nLimitations (Known Issues)\r\n==========================\r\n * not particularly tolerant to poorly-formed HTML input (using Tidy first may help).\r\n * large files or large tables can take a while to render\r\n * CSS float is not supported (but is in the works).\r\n * If you find this project useful, please consider making a donation.\r\n\r\n(Any funds donated will be used to help further development on this project.)\t\r\n[![Donate button](https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif)](http://goo.gl/DSvWf)\r\n","name":"dompdf","tagline":"dompdf project","google":"UA-7721386-5"}
